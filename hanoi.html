          <p>Well, The ancient art form of water puppetry has long been associated with Hanoi. Watch as puppets dance
            elegantly, controlled by a whole troupe of puppet masters, telling a story of the famous Legend of the
            Restored Sword of King Le which is about Hoan Kiem Lake and the giant tortoise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paras">
          <h3>#guest2</h3>
          <p>I believe that you should go to Hoan Kiem Lake (Turtle Lake) which is a popular hangout spot for locals and
            foreigners alike. On an island in the center lies Ngoc Son Temple, linked by a graceful red bridge. This
            serves as a beautiful background for photos, and perhaps you may even catch couples doing their engagement
            photoshoots.</p>

          <h3>#guest3</h3>
          <p>I personally recommend you Dong Xuan Market which is the largest market in Hanoi. Four storeys tall, you
            can find
            all sorts of apparel, electronic items and food. Great for some shopping or to just experience the
            day-to-day life of the locals. You can practice some bargaining here as it is a popular tourist market, and
            prices quoted may be slightly inflated.</p>

          <h3>#guest4</h3>
          <p>Have you ever heard about Hanoi Opera House which was built in 1911, this is one of the most elegant buildings in all of Hanoi. Visitors can enjoy opera and
            dance performances to this day. It was modeled after the Paris Opera House, and the intricate design is even
            more beautiful at night when the cream-colored floodlights get turned on.</p>
