                <h3>#guest1</h3>
                <p>Well, The ancient art form of water puppetry has long been associated with Hanoi. Watch as puppets
                    dance
                    elegantly, controlled by a whole troupe of puppet masters, telling a story of the famous Legend of
                    the
                    Restored Sword of King Le which is about Hoan Kiem Lake and the giant tortoise.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paras">
                <h3>#guest2</h3>
                <p>I believe that you should go to Hoan Kiem Lake (Turtle Lake) which is a popular hangout spot for
                    locals and
                    foreigners alike. On an island in the center lies Ngoc Son Temple, linked by a graceful red bridge.
                    This
                    serves as a beautiful background for photos, and perhaps you may even catch couples doing their
                    engagement
                    photoshoots.</p>

                <h3>#guest3</h3>
                <p>I personally recommend you Dong Xuan Market which is the largest market in Hanoi. Four storeys tall,
                    you
                    can find
                    all sorts of apparel, electronic items and food. Great for some shopping or to just experience the
                    day-to-day life of the locals. You can practice some bargaining here as it is a popular tourist
                    market, and
                    prices quoted may be slightly inflated.</p>

                <h3>#guest4</h3>
                <p>Have you ever heard about Hanoi Opera House which was built in 1911, this is one of the most elegant
                    buildings in all of Hanoi. Visitors can enjoy opera and
                    dance performances to this day. It was modeled after the Paris Opera House, and the intricate design
                    is even
                    more beautiful at night when the cream-colored floodlights get turned on.</p>
