                <p>The War Remnants Museum is one of the most moving sights in Ho Chi Minh City and is dedicated to
                    educating
                    visitors about the atrocities of the Vietnam War.<br>This is one of the most popular museums in all
                    of
                    Vietnam and more than half a million visitors come here
                    every year.<br>Some of the items on display include old military vehicles like Huey helicopters as
                    well as
                    attack bombers
                    and M48 Patton tanks.<br>Inside you will also find personal memorabilia of victims of the war as
                    well as old

                <p>Ho Chi Minh City may be full of traffic, crowded and hot. But there’s much more to it than these
                    generalisations. Being patient with the Vietnamese city will lead you to temples, French colonial
                    architecture and serene neighbourhoods, far from the chaos. Here are 20 must-visit attractions in Ho
                    Chi
                    Minh City.</p>

                <h3>#guest3</h3>
                <p>I personally recommend you The Saigon River, with its constantly running ferries, river taxis, and
                    motor-canoes, offers one of the
                    most tempting invitations to the city’s sunset charms. And there is no better place than a seat at
                    The Deck
                    for a sunset cocktail.</p>

                <p>You can get a glimpse of what the local art scene looks like and what local artists are up to at HCMC
                    Museum of Fine Arts. This dauntingly huge complex with an appealing mix of French and Chinese
                    architectural
                    styles was owned by a Chinese-born businessman who was known as one of the city’s richest men at the
                    time it
                    was constructed.</p>
