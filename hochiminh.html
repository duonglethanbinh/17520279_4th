          <p>The War Remnants Museum is one of the most moving sights in Ho Chi Minh City and is dedicated to educating
            visitors about the atrocities of the Vietnam War.<br>This is one of the most popular museums in all of
            Vietnam and more than half a million visitors come here
            every year.<br>Some of the items on display include old military vehicles like Huey helicopters as well as
            attack bombers
            and M48 Patton tanks.<br>Inside you will also find personal memorabilia of victims of the war as well as old
            photographs..</p>

          <h3>#guest2</h3>
          <p>Ho Chi Minh City may be full of traffic, crowded and hot. But there’s much more to it than these
            generalisations. Being patient with the Vietnamese city will lead you to temples, French colonial
            architecture and serene neighbourhoods, far from the chaos. Here are 20 must-visit attractions in Ho Chi
            Minh City.</p>

          <h3>#guest3</h3>
          <p>I personally recommend you The Saigon River, with its constantly running ferries, river taxis, and
            motor-canoes, offers one of the
            most tempting invitations to the city’s sunset charms. And there is no better place than a seat at The Deck
            for a sunset cocktail.</p>

          <h3>#guest4</h3>
          <p>You can get a glimpse of what the local art scene looks like and what local artists are up to at HCMC
            Museum of Fine Arts. This dauntingly huge complex with an appealing mix of French and Chinese architectural
            styles was owned by a Chinese-born businessman who was known as one of the city’s richest men at the time it
            was constructed.</p>
