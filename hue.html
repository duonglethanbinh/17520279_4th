                <p>Have you ever hear? Top Vietnamese fashion designers flaunt their creativity by re-imagining
                    traditional Ao
                    Dais. In this
                    popular show, designers use Vietnamese silk and Hue folk art to create gorgeous traditional wear.
                    The
                    elegant combination of modern Ao Dai styles and traditional art is easily one of the top things to
                    see
                    during the festival.</p>

                <h3>#guest2</h3>
                <p>The Hue Royal Inspiration performance depicts the history of Vietnam during the 19th century and is
                    held
                    inside the ancient citadel. History during this era will be told in a sequence of historical events
                    that
                    explore the festival’s 2018 theme, which highlights Hue’s five UNESCO-recognized heritages: Hue
                    monuments,
                    Royal Court music, The Nguyen Dynasty woodblocks, Imperial Archives of the Nguyen Dynasty, and
                    Literature of
                    Hue Royal Architecture. The story is told through dramatic music and dance and it’s a unique
                    experience to
                    see the history of Hue condensed into a (relatively) short, beautiful performance.</p>

                <h3>#guest3</h3>
                <p>If you’re not in the mood to attend a ticketed event, you’ll be hard-pressed to wander Hue’s lovely
                    streets
                    without encountering fascinating outdoor art exhibits, installations, and games that inevitably
                    capture a
                    bystander’s attention. This year there are human chess games, dragon boat races, colorful displays
                    (with a
                    selfie line-up or two), and delicious food stalls decorating the city. It really is a cultural
                    spectacle
                    that showcases hundreds of talented Vietnamese artists. There is also a hot air balloon show!</p>
