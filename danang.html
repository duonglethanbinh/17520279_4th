                <p>Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, the My Son Sanctuary is a large cluster of abandoned
                    Hindu
                    temples, constructed between the 4th and the 14th centuries A.D. by the Champa civilization. They
                    are
                    referred to as the Angkor Wat of Vietnam. The ruins are both enchanting and photogenic, as they are
                    overgrown with weeds and surrounded by mountains.</p>
